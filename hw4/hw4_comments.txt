Very clear. Another interesting point is that in some cases the failure of a test (false positive)
might not be independent across tests on the same individual/infection, e.g. if there is something
about the genotype of the individual that makes them *always* test positive ...

About your hypothesis: (1) why Bayesian? This seems like a fairly straightforward problem where you
wouldn't need all the Bayesian machinery, unless you have informative priors you want to include.
What is your comparator?  Are you asking whether hospitalization of 65+ year individuals is higher
for COVID-19 than for other respiratory illnesses, or higher than for COVID-19 for other age groups, or ... ?
(The latter seems like a bit of a no-brainer -- is there a reason you would want to *test* this hypothesis,
rather than (say) quantifying the magnitudes of the differences, with uncertainty?

To do a frequentist likelihood comparison you'll need to specify a likelihood function (e.g., do you think
the data are Normally distributed? Binomial?); for Bayesian tests you'll also need a prior. What did you have
in mind?
