## CDC RESP-NET data
COVID-NET, RSV-NET, and FluSurv-NET (RESP-NET) are population-based surveillance systems that collect data on laboratory-confirmed hospitalizations among children and adults through a network of over 250 acute-care hospitals in 14 states. RESP-NET collects surveillance data on laboratory-confirmed, RESP-associated hospitalizations, including those resulting in ICU admission or death, among children and adults. Data are collected and reported from a network of sites in acute-care hospitals during the October 1â€“April 30 season each year. The .csv file "Rates_of_Laboratory-Confirmed_RSV__COVID-19__and_Flu_Hospitalizations_from_the_RESP-NET_Surveillance_Systems_20240115.csv" contains hospitalization rates for Covid-19, RSV, and flu from 2018-2023 aggregated by disease and race/ethnicity. Hospitalization rates are calculated as the number of residents in a surveillance area who are hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19/RSV/flu divided by the total population estimate for that area.

The biological questions I would hope to answer about these data include do the spread of these respiratory viruses have an advantageous affect on one another and are there disease prevalence disparities present between races and if so, what mechanisms lead to these disparities.
