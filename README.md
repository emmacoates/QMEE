## CDC COVID-19 Case Surveillance Public Use Data
The COVID-19 case surveillance database includes individual-level data reported to U.S. states and autonomous reporting entities, including New York City and the District of Columbia (D.C.), as well as U.S. territories and affiliates. The .csv file contains case counts for each county in each U.S. state aggregated by gender and race. The short-hand variables for each column are explained in the document at https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/file-layouts/2010-2019/cc-est2019-alldata.pdf.
