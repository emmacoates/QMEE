Questions seem fine.  Be careful about asking whether there is *any* effect of X on Y in a biological system; there always is ... "have an advantageous effect on one another" is a little vague. What mechanism(s) do you have in mind for the incidence of one disease being correlated with that of another (presumably this is what you mean at the observable/operational level?), and how could you distinguish them?  (Overall I would more expect *interference* between diseases -- negative rather than positive correlation -- due to quarantine ... see Rohani et al 1998 and lots of other papers by Rohani)

Now that you know how to use git, you should probably clean up your repo a little bit (e.g., delete your sample script)
